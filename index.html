              <h2 id="header2">Popeye, the GOD of forearms:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Birth</strong> - Made his debut in January 17, 1929 as a rough sailor for hire.</li>
                <li><strong>Powers</strong> - His strength all started when he rubbed a magic whiffle hen's head (Bernice), giving him the power to withstand gunshots.</li>
                <li><strong>Icon</strong> - Well-known for squinting his right eye, his gracious forearms, corncob pipe and anchor tattoos.</li>
                <li><strong>Resourceful</strong> - He sometimes uses his corncob pipe to blow smoke in the eyes of his enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>Slay</strong> - Popeye actually started off as a minor character, but he was such an icon that he became the main character and slayed all day.</li>
                <li><strong>Mr Steal yo girl</strong> - He stole Ham Gravy's girl, Olive oil because he's just that guy.</li>
                <li><strong>Independence</strong> - Popeye used to be a character from illustrations alone but thought "it was lame" so he just started moving in 1960 and started his own animated television series. We love an independent king.</li>
                <li><strong>Isekai</strong> - in 1980, Popeye got bored of being a fictional character and then just mainfested into human form along with the rest of the cast.</li>
                <li><strong>Fatherhood</strong> - in 1987 Popeye finally decided to marry his long time girlfriend, Olive Oyl and had a son.</li>
                <li><strong>Legends never die</strong> - After the movie, Popeye didn't make any more apperances and that was the end of the legend of Popeye.</li>
              </ul>
